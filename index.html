            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Cobra Kai Karate is an American karate dojo originally established by John Kreese and Terrance "Terry" Silver after their return from the Vietnam war. Cobra Kai or The Way Of The Fist is an aggressive, strong, ruthless, and merciless style of karate. John Kreese learned hand-to-hand combat from Captain Turner, who learned Tang Soo Do from Kim Sun-Yung, founder of the style. Cobra Kai karate is heavily kick-oriented and focuses less on self-defense; instead, students are taught the best defense is more offense, diametrically opposed to Miyagi-Do Karate. It is known for the ruthless tactics that are taught to the students.</p>
            <p>From the 1970s to the 1980s, Kreese served as the sensei of the dojo. He instructed his students to show no mercy towards their enemies and punished them when they didn't follow through. This made the students vicious and unethical in their fights. The dojo ran into severe financial issues in 1984 following the dojo's loss to the Miyagi-Do in the All-Valley Tournament. The entire student body was disenchanted with the poor attitude of Kreese following the loss and dropped out of the dojo. Kreese had no eligible candidates for the 1985 All-Valley tournament as well as no means to meet the dojo's expenses due to lack of tuition until bailed out by Silver, who also recruited Mike Barnes to participate in the forthcoming tournament. When the All-Valley board witnessed the dojo's inappropriate fighting style in this tournament, its charter was revoked.</p>
            <p>34 years after his defeat in the 1984 All Valley tournament and 33 years after the 1985 All Valley tournament, Johnny Lawrence re-opens the dojo. However, after a secret negotiation between the landlord and Kreese, Johnny is betrayed by Kreese, who takes back Cobra Kai, leading to Johnny losing the dojo. Johnny subsequently opens the Eagle Fang Karate dojo to contest with Cobra Kai. Once Silver got back into the fray of Cobra Kai, he would move the Cobra Kai Dojo to it's original location in a better part of town. After Silver leads Cobra Kai to a victory in the 51st All Valley Karate Tournament, through deceptive and unethical ways, he betrays and has Kreese arrested, which allows him to usurp Cobra Kai.</p>
            <p>As the sole sensei of Cobra Kai, Silver works to have Cobra Kai to become the leading dojo in the world. He hires multiple senseis, including the granddaughter of his master. He also deceives his way into getting Cobra Kai selected to compete in the world tournament of karate, the Sekai Taikai, though Miyagi-Do Karate and Eagle Fang Karate are selected as well. Eventually, the Miyagi-Do's and Eagle Fangs, along with former Cobra Kai student, Tory Nichols, expose Silver's cheating in the All Valley tournament, and this, combined with Silver being defeated by Daniel, led to all of his students leaving him and the dojo. Silver is then arrested, leaving Cobra Kai being shut down for good. However, after Kreese's escape, he went to Korea to re-establish Cobra Kai alongside Kim Da-Eun. The dojo arrived in Barcelona, Spain for the Sekai Taikai and quickly managed to advance to the semi-finals alongside Miyagi-Do and Iron Dragons (Silver's new dojo). Unfortunately, an all-dojo brawl erupted, which ended with the accidental death of Cobra Kai's ruthless top student and male captain, Kwon Jae-Sung.</p>
            <p>A month later, when the world tournament is back on, Tory was left alone participating for Cobra Kai until Kreese formally passed the ownership back to Johnny, with Miguel Diaz as Kwon's replacement in the male's captain's position, after Robby Keene severely injured in the semifinal of the Sekai Taikai against Axel Kovačević. Tory and Miguel face off against the captains of Iron Dragons, Zara Malik and Axel, respectively, and won until realizing that the points end with a tie, leading off to a tie breaker with Johnny facing off against the sensei of Iron Dragons, Feng Xiao (also known as Sensei Wolf). When Silver attempted to sabotage Johnny, Kreese stepped in and sacrificed himself by blowing up the yacht Silver's on to save Johnny and his family. At the day of the final match, Johnny struggled against Wolf, but ultimately won the match thanks to Daniel's pep talk, leading Cobra Kai to its victory for the Sekai Taikai as the very first from America. As a result, Johnny reopened Cobra Kai at his original dojo.</p>
            <p>After that, some years later, Johnny hired a new Sensei to teach the students. He is Franco Cavalieri, known for his incredible achievement of being the only one who won the All-Valley 3 times in-row. A new age has begin!</p>
